# genetictree
all below aplications were made for a self learning perpuses. Not for production and not for presentaiton :) This project contains three apps:

1. tree app -  I've tried to do my family getetictree database.
                Just a list of all members of my family. Shord destription of each person, age, where is she/he lives and so on.
2. wallet app  - It was an idea to create an app for online registration of all my expences.

3. iana app - That is for my girlfried. And this app is almost empty and not working at all.

Current project is under development. A lot of funtionality and features was not implemented yet!!! 
ATTENTION!!! This project could damage your brain :)

I've used Django web app IDE, and run my project on a Heroku Cloud aplication platform.
